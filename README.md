The goal of this project is to get more comfortable with git and develop a web based project that will
1. Provide an interactive platform, chat experience, pictures, and video if possible.
2. Use a nonrelational database to scale
3. Use react and adjacent technologies to create an immersive and interactive page.
4. Improve and have fun.
